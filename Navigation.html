            <p class="lead">Utilising bootstrap’s Navbar is the area I’ve struggled the most with, and it’s where I’ve spent the most time in this project. I would say that I still haven’t managed to get underneath the problem properly, I’ve fixed issues with bodges.</p>
            <hr class="my-4">
            <p>I began the site by finding a background image, and spent a good bit of time working out how to resize
              it depending on the size of the browser window. I went through img-fluid and tested a couple of java scripts
              before concluding it was easier to do it in css directly.</p>
            <p>Doing some research, a lot of my issues are likely due to inconsistent bootstrap libraries. The tutorials I found mainly cover bootstrap version 4, so I imported the version 4 script libraries for bootstrap, jquery and popper. The style sheet I’ve used has always been version 5, though. </p>
            <h1>Baby Steps</h1>
            <p>I started this element of the project by building an example navbar based on the documentation:</p>
            <div class="codeContainer"><pre><code>
      &lt;nav class="navbar navbar-expand-lg navbar-light bg-light"&gt;
      &lt;a class="navbar-brand" href="#"&gt;Navbar&lt;/a&gt;
      &lt;button class="navbar-toggler" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#navbarNav" aria-controls="navbarNav" aria-expanded="false" aria-label="Toggle navigation"&gt;
          &lt;span class="navbar-toggler-icon"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/button&gt;
      &lt;div class="collapse navbar-collapse" id="navbarNav"&gt;
          &lt;ul class="navbar-nav"&gt;
              &lt;li class="nav-item active"&gt;
                  &lt;a class="nav-link" href="#"&gt;Home &lt;span class="sr-only"&gt;(current)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
              &lt;/li&gt;
              &lt;li class="nav-item"&gt;
                  &lt;a class="nav-link" href="#"&gt;Features&lt;/a&gt;
              &lt;/li&gt;
              &lt;li class="nav-item"&gt;
                  &lt;a class="nav-link" href="#"&gt;Pricing&lt;/a&gt;
              &lt;/li&gt;
              &lt;li class="nav-item"&gt;
                  &lt;a class="nav-link disabled" href="#"&gt;Disabled&lt;/a&gt;
              &lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/nav&gt;
            </code></pre></div>
            <p>I then replaced the brand with a logo that I generated. Took a bit of tweaking to ensure it was the right size, but that step was fairly easy. I also changed the background to <b>bg-dark</b> which gave me:</p>
            <img src="images/Screenshot 2024-10-30 at 15.01.39.png" class="img-fluid">
            <p>Starting to come together!</p>
            <p>I then removed <b>bg-dark</b> and added a css line where I could start playing around with different backgrounds. The one I ended up with:</p>
            <div class="codeContainer"><pre><code>
  .navbar {
    background-color: #17010192;
  }
            </code></pre></div>
            <p>Changing the class from <b>navbar-light</b> to <b>navbar-dark</b> and my aesthetic was coming together!</p>
            <img src="images/Screenshot 2024-10-30 at 15.02.42.png" class="img-fluid">
            <h2>Finding the first problems</h2>
            <p>I then started playing with screensize and it was here that I started running into problems. When I reduced the size of my screen, the menu vanished accordingly, and a dropdown icon appeared, but when I clicked on it, nothing happened.</p>
            <img src="images/Screenshot 2024-10-30 at 15.07.41.png" class="img-fluid">
            <p>A few other people on stackoverflow had encountered similar issues. The first recommendation was to include jquery and popper in my library scripts, which I added, though this didn’t fix the issue for me. It took me longer than I want to share that the documentation I was reading was for bootstrap version 4, not version 5 – which was the version provided in the CS50 distributed code. I solved this by changing the library to bootstrap version 4. With the benefit of hindsight, I should have instead gone to find the version 5 documentation, as changing to version 4 created issues for me down the line.</p>
            <p>Changing the navbar items to appropriately link my pages and adding a header reference in the class tag for them gave me a decent looking bar! The last aesthetic change I wanted to make was to align the menu to the right of the screen. Doing some investigating landed me with a css amendment <b>margin-left: auto;</b> Things seemed to be doing well!</p>
            <h2>The Dropdown Menu</h2>
            <p>I continued finalising the rest of the site, before coming to the realisation that I wanted to add a dropdown menu to the navbar. I had a goal of adding a few blog pages, which I thought would go nicely.</p>
            <p>Going back to the documentation gave me:</p>
            <div class="codeContainer"><pre><code>
    &lt;li class="nav-item dropdown"&gt;
      &lt;a class="nav-link dropdown-toggle" href="#" id="navbarDropdownMenuLink" data-toggle="dropdown" aria-haspopup="true" aria-expanded="false"&gt;
          Dropdown link
      &lt;/a&gt;
      &lt;div class="dropdown-menu" aria-labelledby="navbarDropdownMenuLink"&gt;
          &lt;a class="dropdown-item" href="#"&gt;Action&lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;a class="dropdown-item" href="#"&gt;Another action&lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;a class="dropdown-item" href="#"&gt;Something else here&lt;/a&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;  
            </code></pre></div>
            <p>That was nice and easy, I thought. Oh how wrong I was.</p>
            <p>Simply adding that underneath my "Blogs and Articles" navigation item didn't really achieve what I wanted, as I’d built a blogs and articles homepage, so I added a new menu item, effectively removing the code “Dropdown Link”, and having it as a separate navigation item. This caused the menu to look like:</p>
            <img src="images/Screenshot 2024-10-30 at 15.32.32.png" class="img-fluid">
            <p>I played around with adding margin-left: auto in a bunch of places, as well as adding the class “dropdown-menu-right” in my code, but none of it worked. This was another case of my v5 css library and my v4 script not shaking hands correctly. I ended up overriding .dropdown-menu-right in my css file.</p>
            <p>I thought that was that, but doing some more testing highlighted yet another v4 v5 issue. The navbar works well on most of the pages, but I had an issue when I'm in a page that's under a dropdown-menu within it. The dropdown menu looks correct when on any of the main pages, but changes when on a page that’s within the dropdown menu itself. Seems the class is changing from dropdown-menu-dark to dropdown-menu-light when in these pages.</p>
            <img src="images/Screenshot_2024-10-30_at_12.06.45.webp" class="img-fluid">
            <img src="images/Screenshot_2024-10-30_at_12.08.29.webp" class="img-fluid">
            <p>After a few hours bashing my head against a wall, I concluded that it was another case of an inconsistency between my version 5 bootstrap css and my version 4 bootstrap script. Changing the script to v5 broke everything, so I was forced to perform another override in my css file.</p>
            <div class="codeContainer"><pre><div>
          .dropdown-menu {
            background-color: #17010192;
          }
          
          .dropdown-menu-right {
              right: 0;
              left: auto;
          }
          
          .dropdown-item {
              color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.502);
              right: 0;
              left: auto;
          }
            </div></pre></div>
            <h1>The journey is the skills you learn</h1>
            <p>What a ball-ache. Although I’m still slightly unhappy with the bodges I used to fix the code, it looks consistent across the different pages. Though whilst I ran out of energy to do a big fix to bring all the code to version 5, I’m probably going to build a web front end for my final project, so those skills will be added along that journey. It’s quite satisfying seeing the page come together and in its final form. It’s something I’ve made, using html libraries and not tools like squarespace. It feels like a massive accomplishment. Time to move onto Lecture 9!</p>
