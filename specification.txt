I've used masses of CSS properties - seen in my css file. 5 of them are:
.background-container {
    width: 100vw;
    height: 120vh;
    background-image: url('images/background.jpg');
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-size: 2400px 1854px;
    background-position: center center;
    background-attachment: fixed;
    transition: background-position 0.3s;
}

a {
    color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.596);
    text-decoration: none;
}

a:hover {
    text-decoration: underLine;
    color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.596);
}

I used JavaScript to automate the bootstrap carousel.
I used tons of bootstrap components, my goal was to add as many of them as I could before I ran out of steam, but the site itself documents my journey through that!
