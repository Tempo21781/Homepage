          <div class="jumbotron">
            <h1 class="display-4">Hello, world!</h1>
            <p class="lead">This is a website documententing my journey through learning and applying bootstrap. 
              I started Problem Set 8 with zero experience in web programming, so it's been a bit of an uphill struggle! 
              On the homepage, I've included a Jumbotron and some cards with an intro to the rest of the site pages. </p>
            <hr class="my-4">
            <p>I began the site by finding a background image, and spent a good bit of time working out how to resize
              it depending on the size of the browser window. I went through img-fluid and tested a couple of java scripts
              before concluding it was easier to do it in css directly.</p>
            <p>It's been a fun project, although what I’ve learned along the way suggests some of the way’s I’ve done things 
              has been a bit amateur. If I were to restart, I would build a grid for everything to fit on to start with. 
              I’ve been adding padding to individual elements to make them look “right”, whereas implementing a simple grid 
              in the beginning would solve a lot of formatting issues. Also getting to grips with bootstrap v5 instead of v4 
              is another project I’ll have to teach myself if/when I continue using these skills.</p>
            <p>The button below toggles a scrolling text modal that goes into more detail about the code I used for these
              elements.</p>
            <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#moreInfo">
              Learn More
            </button>
            </div>
        </div>
          

        <div class="modal fade" id="moreInfo" tabindex="-1" role="dialog" aria-labelledby="exampleModalLongTitle" aria-hidden="true">
          <div class="modal-dialog" role="document">
            <div class="modal-content">
              <div class="modal-header">
                <h5 class="modal-title" id="exampleModalLongTitle">More information</h5>
              </div>
              <div class="modal-body">
                <h2>Initial Images and Sizing</h2>
                  <p>I started without any real idea of what I was doing, so I thought I’d get the 
                    template for the site done. Finding a background image through a free wallpaper 
                    (credited in the alternative text of the image) and throwing a quick logo together
                    were my first stops. </p>
                  <p>With the images in hand, I wanted to dynamically size it depending on the size of 
                    the browser. I started playing around with img-fluid, but it didn’t really achieve 
                    what I wanted – the vision was to have an image centralised and it zoom in depending 
                    on the size of the device. I played around with some java script (using 
                    window.addEventListener and window.innerWidth) but I couldn’t get them to work. </p>
                  <p>I finally investigated CSS, which is what is in the current code. I set a container
                    who’s aim is to have everything in it (background-container, set it’s background to 
                    the image (with a specific size) then set the background position to top center. </p>
                  <p>Before getting stuck into the meat of my web programming, I had a read through the 
                    bootstrap documentation, to understand the functionality I could access with it. </p>
                <h2>The Jumbotron</h2>
                  <p>From bootstrap’s documentation, the jumbotron is a “Lightweight, flexible component 
                    for showcasing hero unit style content.” I take it as giving the user a container and 
                    some additional styling elements. I had to tweak it a bit, because I wanted it to 
                    show on top of my background image, so I changed the colour to a transparent grey. I 
                    also wanted the appearance of a centralised block, so I added a line in my css styles 
                    for it. My first test was to set the max-width to a specific figure, bit I found that 
                    aligned the container to the left, which I didn’t want. Doing a bit of searching 
                    landed me with margin: auto which centralised the container. Adding a bit of padding 
                    for aesthetics and it looked OK!</p>
                <h2>The Cards</h2>
                  <p>Adding cards looked like a neat trick which would work well on a homepage, so I dived 
                    in. Bootstap’s documentation is pretty self-explanatory, but I had to play around with 
                    the class of grid I wanted to lay the cards on. </p>
                  <p>The default class (col-sm-6) seemed to do weird things when I scaled the size of my 
                    browser, so I looked into the grid formatting options. Reading the grid documentation, 
                    the number after the col-sm indicates the number of cards you want per row, but there 
                    is a default you can use which is removing that specification.</p>
                  <p>Adding css lines (as I did for jumbotron) gave me the styling I wanted, so it was a 
                    success!</p>
